# Azur Lane Scripts Autopatcher
Forked from k0np4ku's source repo

From k0np4ku:
Archive repository of the old Autopatcher:

**v2.x.x** contains the source code of old autopatcher (2018)\
**v3.x.x** contains the source code of an autopatcher which I've never fully publish to github (2019)

## Installation
**No installation required**

1. Download latest build and 3rd party tools from https://github.com/n0k0m3/Archive-Azur-Lane-Scripts-Autopatcher/releases

2. Extract 3rdparty tools INSIDE your patcher folder (make sure the path will be `ALSA_<version>\3rdparty\*`

**Note:** If the build doesn't include 3rd party tools, it doesn't mean that it is not needed, it means that 3rd party tools are not changed, check for it from older build
